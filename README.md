## purpose
this repository is part of my experiment with worldbuilding. its primary purpose is the storage of ideas and resources, but it also serves as a public face for the project.
a website is hosted from repository acting as a private 'library' into all current known knowledge of this built world. i aim for the site to hold books written from the perspective of explorers, books written by the people's they encountered, images of artifacts, works of literature, treatises etc.
## technology
not looking to do anything fancy so no modern frameworks here
- bootstrap 5
- the very basics
